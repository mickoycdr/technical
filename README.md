<!-- My design choices and inspirations -->
The design I used is clean and modern, with a Dark Charcoal background (Inspired from the given logo of Pl8full)for a bold look and Soft Beige text for easy reading. I also used Deep Maroon to add contrast in highlights and borders, while I used Warm Gold to make titles and quotes stand out. I also used Muted Olive for subtle shadows to add depth. I believe the colors work well together, keeping things stylish, readable, and in line with the logo.

<!-- Any Challenges I faced -->
One of the biggest challenges I faced was working with the design inspired by the given logo, which only had two colors—dark charcoal and bright yellow. At first, it seemed easy, but designing around it was actually tougher than I expected. Dark-themed designs may look simple, but in reality, it's not. Because every color choice has to be spot-on—too dull, and it loses impact, too bright, and it messes with readability. I had to be extra mindful of the balance to make sure everything looked sharp, professional, and visually appealing.  

On top of that, the given time limit was 24 hours, but I challenged myself to finish in just 15. I wanted to see if I could not only design a full homepage but also do proper research on branding—without sacrificing quality.
